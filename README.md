# MongoDB $in operator with an empty array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries related to using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The issue arises when attempting to query a collection using `$in` with an empty array, which may not behave as expected.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is used to match documents where a field value is present in a given array. However, providing an empty array leads to unexpected results.  Instead of returning all documents, as one might intuitively expect, it may return an empty result set.

## Solution
To avoid this unexpected behavior, ensure that the array passed to the `$in` operator is never empty. Implement logic to handle empty arrays appropriately, perhaps by returning all documents or using an alternative query approach if an empty array indicates a specific condition.
